What are interfaces?
Interfaces are like contracts
When a class "implements"  an interface, it signs a contract
The contract is to provide the specific properties and methods defined in the interface.

We will create 2 interfaces that provide logic for updating a canvas element.
Movable and Drawable are going to be our interfaces providing the structure we need.

Syntax 
interface someName{}

It defines the structure that an obj/class must abide to.
